# Conclusion

First, give yourself a hearty pat for making it through. Writing a codemod is an advanced technique, and you likely encountered and had to quickly understand several new concepts.

To summarize what you learned:

- `@codemod-utils` provides a set of tools and conventions to help you write codemods.
- Break the problem into small steps. There may be a sequence of steps that makes it easier to solve the problem.
- Before implementing the first step, create fixture project(s) for acceptance tests. You can then run `codemod-test-fixtures.sh` to see the effect of your code change.
- Take the simplest approach to implement steps quickly. Prefer duplication over premature abstraction.
- After implementing all steps, refactor code. Write integration and unit tests to improve documentation.
