    ```sh

<summary>Publish package (for admins)</summary>

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/) in GitHub, with `repo` and `read:user` scopes enabled.

1. Run the `release:changelog` script. This removes changesets, updates the package version, and updates the `CHANGELOG`.

    ```sh
    GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> pnpm release:changelog
    ```

1. [Create a tag](https://github.com/<your-github-handle>/<%= options.codemod.name %>/releases/new) and provide release notes. The tag name should match the package version.

1. Publish the package.

    ```sh
    pnpm release:publish
    ```
