# Introduction

Thanks for trying out `@codemod-utils`!

In this tutorial, we will create a codemod called `ember-codemod-rename-tests` (to be precise, rename test modules). It is practical (i.e. solves a real-life problem) and has the right scopeâ€”enough to cover the essentials (e.g. take small steps, read and write files, refactor code), but not too large to overwhelm you.
